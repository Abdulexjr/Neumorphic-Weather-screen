Hey folks,

There is been a buzz about what design trend will take over in 2020 and very recently, soft UI also known as Neumorphism is taking on the design market rapidly. So, I gave it a try and it was AWESOME working with shadows and elevation after a long time since flat design has taking the market for so long.

Do you think the Neumorphism will be the next big thing in design trends?
